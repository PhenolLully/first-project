## Concept

```md
A certain amount of jokes are randomly generated based on user-inputted 
search criteria at the click of a button. Jokes are pulled from different APIs 
and displayed below the application. When a user finds a joke they really like, 
they can favorite it and save it to a list which they can see whenever they 
revisit the page
```


## User Story

```md
AS someone who loves a good joke every now and then,
I WANT to generate one of two types of my favorite jokes at the click of a button,
SO that I can have a laugh whenever I need one.
I also want to save my favorite jokes,
SO that I can save them for later.
```


## Acceptance Criteria

```md
When a user opens the main search page,
They are presented with two buttons.
Each button generates a random joke based on their respective categories (dad jokes and
programming jokes).
When a user presses one of the two buttons,
A single random joke will be pulled from one of two API databases, and generated under
the buttons.
Then the user will be left with the option to generate another joke between the two.
When a user finds a joke they really love,
They can save the joke to their favorites (local storage) so they can revisit it when they
want.
When a user clicks the “Favorite Jokes” button at the top, a modal will appear populated
with each joke that the user has favorited. (saved to the local storage)
```


## Direction of Future Development

```md
Our next feature will be adding a delete button for each joke in the 
favorites modal.
To increase usability, we aim to add as many joke APIs / databases as we 
can. From this, we can widen the scope of our target audience.
This application is meant to be a lightweight, comedic tool for various 
social situations, and when users are looking to raise their spirits with a 
quick laugh. We will work to increase a client that can be accessed across 
most devices with a smooth and polished user interface.
